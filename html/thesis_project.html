                  <h3>Design Concept</h3>
                  <p>
                    The design concept integrates fashion and architectural
                    principles, dividing the site into private (institute),
                    semi-public (commercial), and public spaces arranged in a
                    circular form for symmetry and unity. The three areas are
                    interconnected and offset equally, creating rhythm and
                    balance with green spaces, while emphasizing key structures
                    like the main institute building and multipurpose hall. This
                    approach aims to produce an iconic landmark that serves
                    society by harmoniously blending design principles with
                    functional spaces.

              <h3>Design Intent</h3>
              <p>
                Fashion entails both imagination and time. A constantly shifting
                phenomena. A spatial modulation of continuous movement in time
                and space in architectural terms. In recent years, fashion has
                taken on enormous importance in our people's daily lives. With
                the winds of adventure and creativity blowing across the fashion
                industry, Indian design is ready to make a global impact. The
                fashion industry necessitates artistic innovation and charm, as
                well as a technical knowledge foundation. This rapidly
                developing sector need a higher level of professionalism. As a
                result, competent fashion technology institutes are required to
                offer a solid foundation for this expanding sector.
              </p>
              <p>
                Design is extremely important in India since it establishes
                living standards and, as a result, the country's economic level,
                as well as the intellectual and psychological growth of its
                people. The objective is to provide interactive, creative
                platforms for diverse fashion industry experts and students, as
                well as to connect architecture and fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                To build a hub with a strong identity that combines fashion,
                business, entertainment, culture, and leisure activities. The
                Project would be created on a commercially self-sustaining basis
                as an integrated development catering to the fashion industry's
                requirements in Pune as a "one-stop-solution."
